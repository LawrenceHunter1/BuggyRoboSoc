# MoveDistanceFromSensor

## Description

### Goal
Using the buggy class perform the steering tests.

### Method
Use buggy class methods to perform all tests in directory.

### Expected behaviour
Turn to furthest point. Turn to nearest point. Turn to furthest point using optimisation. Turn to nearest point using optimisation.

### Setup
Full arduino setup with ultrasonic sensor attached to servo, dual motors.

### Behaviour
1. Buggy head scans environment and rotates to furthest
2. Buggy head scans environment and rotates to nearest
3. Buggy head scans environment and rotates to furthest in fewer steps
4. Buggy head scans environment and rotates to nearest in fewer steps
5. Buggy idles
